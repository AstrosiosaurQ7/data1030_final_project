    "Final presentation        \n",
    "The purpose of the semester-long project is to give you hands-on experience working with a machine learning pipeline. For the final presentation, the focus is on the cross validation pipeline, the algorithms and parameters you tried, scores and uncertainties, and model explanations. The presentation is intended as a summary of your final project report.      \n",
    "\n",
    "The project presentations are on December 5th-6th-7th. Everyone will have a 10 minute slot and we will release the sign-up sheets soon. You will have 6 minutes to present, 2-3 minutes for questions, and 1 min to change speakers. Please make sure to be there for the whole two hour slot on the day you present. There will be some empty slots in the sign-up sheet and we will move your presentation ahead of time if that happens so we won’t wait around idly.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Please show the draft of your slides and your final project report to your TA mentor before the presentations. Note that if you ask your TA mentor for feedback at the last minute, they might not be able to get back to you because each TA mentors ~13 students. They are not required to reply to email during the weekend or outside of the regular 9-5 hours. So plan ahead and give them at least one workday to reply!     \n",

    "Please submit your pdf slides to gradescope by 4pm on December 7th (6pm grade period). If you submit after the grace period, we will deduct 2 points as a late submission penalty (students with a doctor’s or Dean’s note are of course exempt).        \n",

    "Title slide (1 point)       \n",

    "Recap slide (2 points)       \n",
    "The intro slide should explain the problem you want to solve, why this is important, whether it’s regression or classification, and where you got the data. Describe briefly the most important/interesting aspects of the preprocessing and the EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation slide(s) (5 points)       \n",
    "Explain how you split the data and why. Describe your CV pipeline. Which supervised ML algorithms did you try? What parameters did you tune? \n",
    "\n",
    "Results slide(s) (10 points)        \n",
    "Describe the test scores of each algorithm you tried. How do your scores compare to a simple baseline model? Inspect your model (e.g., confusion matrix, scatter plot of the true vs predicted values in regression, global/local feature importances).         \n",
    "\n",
    "Outlook slide(s) (2 points)\n",
    "Describe what else you could try to improve either the predictive power or the interpretability of your model given more time.         \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your time! (You have a 30 sec grace period, after which we will subtract 3 points for every minute you go overtime; we round up to the minute)        \n",
    "Please practice your presentation out loud at least once before and make sure you can fit everything into 6 minutes. It is rude to go overtime and delay the presentations of others.      \n"

The readme file should give an overview of the project, it states what python version and package versions were used to develop the code so others can run it locally and reproduce your results (add a yaml file for ease of use).
